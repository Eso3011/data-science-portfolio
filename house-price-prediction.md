## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on property features. The goal was to build a regression model that can estimate house prices accurately using historical housing data.

## Approach
I followed a complete data science pipeline:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature selection
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluating performance using RMSE and R²

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Outcome
The trained model was able to predict house prices with good accuracy, showing how machine learning can be used for real-world prediction problems.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Regression modeling  
- Model evaluation  
- Feature engineering  
- Data preprocessing  
- Machine learning workflow
